### Why did you build this project?
Hours spent on looking for that python anwsers online. And een though you have a stackoverflow account you just don't
have the energy to deal with code dumping that is remotely the point or mabye you have enoughing to dump.
I and all of our Collaborators have had this problem. This project was conceived for a school assigment to develop a website
out of our own imagination in a time span of ... .

## The solution!
Pyshare solve the endless looking for answer on online and dropping pointless code dumps. Pyshare is as the name suggest
it is a Python only deal. Where the user post **UNITTEST** of what problem they need help with. Giving user a **Test Driven**
platform for asking for help and instead of wasting it on words just write a **TEST**.
- **TEST CASES** for what the user needs help with.

By also posting test missunderstandment will dractictlly switch from writting prefect description to just looking at the test
and writting a solution for it.

## What could have been!
This solution will not be the simple green checkbox stackoverflow stuff but instead many users after getting the pass on the unittest can post
the solution and then rate the others users solutions(Like in codewars withe Best practices, Clever, ..., effective, average).
