## Why did you build this project?
Hours spent on looking for that python answers online. And even though you have a stackoverflow account you just don't 
have the energy to deal with code dumping that is remotely the point or maybe you have enoughing to dump.
I and all of our Collaborators have had this problem. This project was conceived for a school assignment to develop a 
website out of our own imagination in a time span of 4-5 weeks.

## The solution!
Pyshare solve the endless looking for answer on online and dropping pointless code dumps. Pyshare is as the name suggest it's 
a Python only deal. Where the user post **UNIT TEST** of what problem they need help with. Giving user a **Test Driven**
platform for asking for help and instead of wasting it on words just write a **TEST**.
- Create **TEST CASES** for what the user needs help with.
- Post Test Case
- Try solving someone else post. Keep testing red until green.
- Someone has solved your post

By also posting test misunderstandment will drastically switch from writing prefect description to just looking at the test 
and writing a solution for it.

## What could have been!
With future implementation post solution would have been rated and only allow for x amout of post but where the lowest rated post
can be replaced if overtaken by someone else newer solution. This will give a atmosphere of competition and more in line with 
platforms such as codewars or leetcode. A concept idea would be to add a section where user can purley ask technical question 
without the coding. This would hopefully help beginner who often need information rather than creating a elaborate test case.
