# PyShare
This will be a stackoverflow type platform where users have profiles and can post problems they need help with.
As the name suggest it will be a Python only deal.

The user have a problem. Now the user loggs in and create a problem post to solve.
This problem Post contain:
- A title for the problem
- A descrption:
	- What needs to be solved in text
	- IF there is anything out of the ordernary
	- with a required solution.
- **TEST CASE CODE** for what needs to be solved. Written by the user

Change for stackoverflow well the test case is to replace the annoying code dump and giving the user the
power to express more exact in a test of what requirement he/she wishes to solve.

The users can now se the new code problem and start building a function that meets the users requirements.
The code will be written in a textbox underneeth the problem post and can be runned against the users test case until it passes.
If the solver(user) gets the green box by passing all test he/she can post the solution.

This solution will not be the simple green box stackoverflow stuff but instead many users after getting the pass on the test can post
the solution and then rate the others users solutions.(Like in codewars withe Best practices, Clever, ..., effective, average)

### Extra features
* A Challenge category:
	- Users can post problem not for a practical reason of help but for challanging other users to solve.
	- THe challenge feature will give more of a ranking to users profiles and their skills
* A Code dump category:
	- A copy-paste of the users code that is relevant to the error as the user percives it.
	- A textbox of a copy-paste with error from 1st line(start) to the last line(finsih)


## Insperation
A merge between stackoverflow and Codewars.
* **Stackoverflow**
