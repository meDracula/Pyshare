		<h2>Pyshare story</h2>
		<h3>The big bang</h3>
		<p>We all know stackoverflow. Stackoverflow was great but as time have gone on the helpers
		have become obsessed with the stackoverflow guidelines. This has lead to developers becomming
		harassed and bulide for wanting help about something.
		</p>
		<h3>How can we do it better?</h3>
		<p>OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
		Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
		Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
		With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
		Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
		Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
		Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
		That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
		In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
		Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill
		Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flow'd
		Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
		Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
		That with no middle flight intends to soar
		Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues
		Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
		And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer
		Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
		Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
		Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
		Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
		And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
		Illumin, what is low raise and support;
		That to the highth of this great Argument
		I may assert Eternal Providence,
		And justifie the wayes of God to men.
